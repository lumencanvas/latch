# LATCH — Session Handoff Log

Running log of work sessions, newest first. Each entry: what changed, current state,
and what's open. Detailed analysis lives in the dated docs under `docs/` (esp.
`NODE_LIBRARY_REVIEW_2026-06-18.md` and `AUDIT_2026-06-16.md`).

## 2026-06-19 — Node-library review + discoverability/UX + first nodes

Branch: `modernization`. All work committed (single-purpose commits, no AI attribution).
Driven by `docs/NODE_LIBRARY_REVIEW_2026-06-18.md` — its implementation-status block tracks
each item; this is the narrative summary.

### Landed
- **Correctness — duplicate node ids fixed.** `counter` (data+code) and `sample-hold`
  (logic+code) collided in the id-keyed registry Map, and the winning *definition* and
  winning *executor* were crossed — leaving both nodes effectively broken. Kept one coherent
  def+executor pair each (`counter`→code, `sample-hold`→logic/utility), deleted the dead
  twins, added a DEV duplicate-id warning in `useNodesStore.register()`, and a
  `registry-integrity` test.
- **Leak — subflow contexts.** `clearAllSubflowContexts()` was called nowhere; added
  `gcSubflowState()` + wired both into `ExecutionEngine` (per-node GC + `stop()`).
- **Discoverability.** Search already matched name+description+tags but most VJ-facing nodes
  had no tags. Added creative-coding vocabulary across the library — tagged-node coverage
  **70 → 148 of 205** (echo/noise/glitch/feedback/tempo/donut/whisper… now resolve; the
  Shader presets are searchable). Added **tag filter-chips** to the Node Explorer and a
  **port-type colour legend**; rendered **per-category icons** (single-source
  `utils/categoryIcons.ts`) in the palette + explorer; hid empty categories; clarified the
  Control Panel empty state.
- **Brand — purple = AI only.** Repointed stray category purples (debug→slate,
  messaging→cyan, subflows→lime) and non-AI accent purples (EQ/parametric-eq→cyan, synth
  section→blue, xy-pad→pink). The `string` *data-type* port colour is intentionally left
  violet (separate colour axis) — open decision if it should change too.
- **New nodes (Tier-A from §2), all stateless + unit-tested:**
  - **Noise** (`math/noise`) — 3D simplex + fBm; value(-1..1)/normalized(0..1); X/Y/Z +
    frequency/octaves/seed.
  - **Color Ramp** (`visual/color-ramp`) — value→colour; 7 colormaps + custom 2-stop;
    `[r,g,b,a]` output matching the Color node.
  - **Euclidean Rhythm** (`timing/euclidean`) — Bjorklund pattern (E(3,8) tresillo,
    E(5,8) cinquillo); stateless, driven by a `step` index; gate/value/pattern outputs.
- **Testing pass.** Added tests for the subflow GC, the `register()` guard, `categoryIcons`
  exhaustiveness, the explorer tag-filter store, Color Ramp preset↔palette sync, plus full
  coverage for Noise / Color Ramp / Euclidean.

### State
Node count **206** (was 205 pre-dedupe; 203 after the dedupe, +3 for Noise/Color
Ramp/Euclidean). Verified green:
`typecheck`, `eslint`, full `test:unit`, and the production `build`. Working tree clean
(only `.DS_Store`). Nothing pushed.

### Open / next
- **Tier-A WebGL nodes** (the signature visual gaps — need render-pipeline integration, not
  drop-in): **feedback buffer** (highest VJ value — trails/echo/zoom), text→texture, discrete
  image-FX, particles.
- **Control Panel allow-list ↔ `exposedControls`** (review Part 4.2): the hardcoded
  `controlNodeTypes`/`monitorNodeTypes` arrays mean custom control nodes never surface.
- **Decision:** recolour the `string` data-type port colour off violet, or keep it.
- **Carried (from `AUDIT_2026-06-16.md`):** the `with(ctx)` non-sandbox + flow-import trust
  prompt + `setWindowOpenHandler` allow-list (security); per-frame storms; lazy executor
  registration; split the `executors/index.ts` + `ai.ts` god-files.
